REACT PROJECT

It is a simple react project made with the view to get familiar with react and redux. It is a pharmacy website with two user loggins. These are:
1. sales-admin  
   usernname: test-admin  
   passwrod: test-admin
2. sales-executive  
   username: test-sales  
   password: test-sales
   
Both the profiles are linked where the admin can store the inventory and executives list along with placing orders and viewing their order history. The sales executive can place orders based on the inventory and view their order history.
Everything is stored in the local storage.
